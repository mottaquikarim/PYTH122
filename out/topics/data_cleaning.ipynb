    "\n",
    "Having null values in your data can cause various issues with your code and with your analysis. Deciding how to deal with null values is a huge part of cleaning your data, and you have to think about each column contextually. At a high level, you can drop rows/columns containing null values or replace all instances of null values with some default value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"how\", you also have to contextually consider the \"when\". You might decide to drop rows containing null values right away so that reformatting is straightforward. Maybe you have to reformat the data before you can fill it with a default value. Then again, you might wait to evaluate how much data is missing until you reformat your data and/or remove other bad data. For example, we got rid of all rows that were TV shows instead of movies first.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the next few example, we'll leverage the `s.map(arg, na_action=None)` function, another **elementwise** function. You can use the `.map(arg, na_action=None)` function to substitute or transform each value in a Series with another value. `.map()` itself serves to pass along \"instructions\" for how to manipulate each element in the Series. Accordingly, the `arg` parameter will accept single-argument functions, dicts, or Series. As you might imagine, `.map()` requires us to pass it a \"mapping\" for the before and after values.\n",
