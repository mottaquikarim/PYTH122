    "The syntax for adding or updating a dataframe's data is as simple as declaring a variable: `df[col_name] = series_name`. What if the data in your Series doesn't have all of the same index values in the same order though? It's important to understand how to get data to flow into the right place in your dataframe in different scenarios. This lesson will present examples for some of the most common use cases such as:\n",
