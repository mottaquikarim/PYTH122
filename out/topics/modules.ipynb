    "When you `modularize` code, it means that you group functions and objects into specific areas of focus. We call these groups `modules` and `packages`. A `module` is a Python source file that contains pre-defined objects like variables, functions, classes, and other items we'll talk about soon. A Python `package`, sometimes used synonymously with the term `library`, is simply a collection of Python modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below can show you this hierarchy visually.\n",

    "For instance, the `statsmodels` module ([here](https://www.statsmodels.org/)) contains code useful to a data scientist. The `Pyglet` library ([here](http://www.pyglet.org/)) contains code useful to game developers needing shortcuts for 3D game animation. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Modular programming` allows us to break out certain packages and modules from the standard library. This means that when you first install Python, the packages and models that have been broken out are NOT installed. If you want to use them, you have to separately import them. It's sort of like \"a la carte\" code, and it makes the standard library more efficient for the general public. This becomes especially valuable once you scale your programs. Why take on extra baggage?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global vs. Local Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons Python leverages modular programming is because it helps avoid conflicts between `local` and `global` variables. It does so by creating separate `namespaces`. `Namespaces` are the place where variables are stored, and they exist on several independent levels, including **local, global, built-in, and nested namespaces**. For instance, the functions `builtin.open()` and `os.open()` are distinguished by their namespaces. Namespaces also aid readability and maintainability by making it clear which module implements a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a variable declared outside a function has `global scope`, meaning you can access a it inside or outside functions. A variable declared within a function has `local scope`, which means you can only access it within the object where you created it. If you try to access the variable outside that object, you will get a `NameError` telling you that variable is not defined. The same goes for functions created within modules, as you'll see soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Modules & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing modules and packages is very easy and saves you a lot of time you'd otherwise spend reinventing the wheel. Modules can even import other modules! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a few different way to import modules and their contents. The simplest way to import a module is to simply write `import module_name`. This will allow you to access all the contents within that module. Take a look at how we use the square root function from the `math` module:  \n"

    "\n",
    "#### Optimize Your Imports\n",

    "In addition to \"built-in\" modules, Python provides the ability to create, distribute and most importantly *consume* community defined Python modules. This is powerful because anyone who builds something useful has the ability to share with the larger python community.
